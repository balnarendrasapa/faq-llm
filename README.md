# LLM for FAQs for E-Commerce Site

We will be building a FAQ chatbot for an E-Commerce site with the help of Large Language Models. We will take an LLM and fine-tune it on custom dataset. Our aim is to build a chatbot that is finetuned on the FAQs asked by users. Users may have some common questions which can be quite common among users. Usually, user goes to FAQ section of the product or calls the customer support to clarify. A Chatbot finetuned periodically, can answer these questions.
